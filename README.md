EDA Analysis conclusion


1.Customer Profile Understanding: Recognize the predominant customer demographics: predominantly female, with a moderate average spending score of 50.2 and an average annual income of 60.56k. Target marketing efforts should align with these demographics to maximize engagement and sales.

2.Segmented Marketing Strategies: Utilize customer segmentation based on income and age groups to tailor marketing campaigns effectively. Focus on middle-income customers (50k-80k) and younger adults (20-40) who exhibit higher spending tendencies for targeted promotions and offerings.

3.Addressing Spending Patterns: Acknowledge the common spending behavior observed, with most customers exhibiting moderate spending scores (40-60). Implement strategies to encourage increased spending through personalized promotions, loyalty programs, and enhanced customer experiences.

4.Catering to Income Diversity: Develop a diversified product and service portfolio that caters to different income. Offer value-oriented options for budget-conscious shoppers (20k-50k), premium offerings for higher-income individuals (80k-130k), and mainstream products for middle-income segments (50k-80k).

5.Optimizing Age Group Engagement: Foster engagement with key age groups (20-25, 30-35, 45-50) by curating relevant events, promotions, and experiences that resonate with their preferences. Address the lower density in the older age group (50-70) by exploring initiatives tailored to attract senior customers.


Insights for Improving Spending Hours:


Personalized Promotions: Implement personalized promotions based on customer profiles to stimulate spending behaviors and incentivize longer visits.

Enhanced Customer Experiences: Enhance overall customer experiences by introducing entertainment options, interactive events, and amenities to encourage extended stays and increased spending.

Loyalty Programs: Develop and promote loyalty programs that reward frequent visits and higher spending, fostering customer loyalty and repeat business.

Collaborations and Partnerships: Collaborate with popular brands, influencers, and local businesses to create exclusive offerings and events that drive foot traffic and spending.

Data-Driven Decision Making: Leverage customer data and analytics to continuously refine marketing strategies, product offerings, and operational decisions, ensuring alignment with customer preferences and behaviors.

Implementing these insights can contribute to optimizing spending hours in malls, fostering customer satisfaction, and ultimately driving revenue growth and business success.

Clustering the customers

Clustering Techniques Used :

1.Kmeans
2.DBscan
3.Agglomerative

Based on the results, the Agglomerative clustering model appears to be the best model, with a higher silhouette score (0.44308912983504156) compared to the K-Means model (0.4155672337697055).
Here are two lines explaining why the Agglomerative clustering model is better:
Better cluster separation: The Agglomerative clustering model is able to separate the data points into distinct clusters with higher cohesion and separation, resulting in a higher silhouette score.
More accurate cluster assignment: The Agglomerative clustering model is able to assign data points to the correct clusters more accurately, which is reflected in the higher silhouette score.
Therefore, the Agglomerative clustering model is the best model for this dataset, as it is able to better separate the data points into distinct clusters and assign them to the correct clusters.
